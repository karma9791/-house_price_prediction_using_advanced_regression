## General Information
- Advanced Regression - House Price Prediction
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. The task is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Conclusions
- when the market value of the property is lower than the Predicted Sale Price, its the time to buy.
